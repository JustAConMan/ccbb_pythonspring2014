#Homework May 21

I've attached a script called [plot.py](https://github.com/wrightaprilm/ccbb_pythonspring2014/blob/master/plot.py). Modify it so you can run it on multiple data files of your choice from class. There are a couple notes in the file about things to look out for and think about. Where could tests be inserted? Feel free to either write the tests, or insert comments describing them.

Also, have a look at [this paper](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)
