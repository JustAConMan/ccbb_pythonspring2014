#Homework May 19

If you didn't finish the in-class exercise, please do this and push it to your GitHub. Email Stephanie and I with questions.

I will e-mail the class with my solution to the exercise. Please have a read-over it, and if anything is unclear, come prepared with questions.

If Github still feels a little alien, that's OK. You don't have to get to it, but there is an online tutorial to help you feel a little more secure here: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
