#Welcome to the first Intro to Python short course offered by the CCBB

Thanks for joining us this week. We've never offered a 4-day intensive short course like this, but we're very excited to experiment with this format.

Below, you'll find the schedule of topics, with links to the pages for each topic. As we explore programming together, some topics may change in response to audience interests.
