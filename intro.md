#Welcome!

Programming is a language, and needs to be practiced. To be successful in this course, we recommend:

+ That you do the in-class exercises, and submit them via GitHub (we'll cover this in a bit).
+ That you at least try the homeworks.
+ That you read, and try to understand the exercise and homework solutions.
+ That you think about how to apply the in-class material to your own data. Perhaps even try to apply it and ask us questions.

We're all adults, and you know your learning style better than we do.

+ We will give plenty of time for hands-on exploration.
+ Ask us questions when you don't understand.
+ We have provided a list of additional resources below. You won't hurt our feelings if you look at them.
+ Frustration and walking into walls are part of learning. Take mental health breaks often, and don't be discouraged by needing Google or documentation.
