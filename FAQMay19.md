##FAQ - Day One

### Built-in functions

These are called with the <object>.[function()] notation. A list can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)

###Comments

Python treats anything on a line after a # as a comment. It will not read these lines, these are just for you.

###Scope

+ If you close an iPython or Python session at the terminal, you will lose everythng in it. These things are not stored to any sort of permanent memory.
+ If you try and call a loop variable outside of a loop, it will hold the last value from the loop

###Saving iPyton output

One of the nice features of iPython is the ability to save output line-by-line:

```python
save script.py 1-13
```

In which script.py is the name of the file to which you'd like to save the commands - this can be literally any file. 1-13 could be any lines of code you'd like to save.

###True and False

These are known as constants. These must be capitalized when testing if something is true or false.
